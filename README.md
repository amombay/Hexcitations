ENGN1735: Vibrations of Mechanical Systems Design Project, Active Particles

Hexcitations is a design project for Brown University's School of Engineering course, ENGN1735: Vibrations of Mechanical Systems, completed by Andrew Mombay, Kaya Bruno, Helen Primis, and Sarah Nguyen in collaboration with the Harris Lab inclusive of Jack-William Barotta and Daniel Harris.

This repository contains the following folders:
- CAD Designs: This serves as the general purpose folder containing all CAD designs completed throughout the project, represented across the different iterations and phases of the project.
  -Cage Design: This sub-folder contains all designs of our cages, beginning with our circular cage model before moving to the rectangular, back-held cage model.
    - Iteration I: This sub-folder contains all designs of our intial, circular filament with PVC tubing linkages. These designs were later scrapped and replaced in favor of smaller, more compact linkages as significant issues were faced with friction and mass-dragging due to the sheer weight of the cage and the inability of the hexbug to provide adequate locomotion and movement of the cage for image tracking purposes.
    - Iteration II: This sub-folder contains all designs of our next model where we shifted towards building cages contained on the hexbugs back with a T-shaped marker for tracking purposes along with circular extrusions for the silicone linkages to attach to. This design was later modified and is thus currently redundnant to allow for a better fit on top of the hexbug and silicone linkage.
    - Iteration III: This represents our most current linkage iteration. Modifications were made to the cage to encourage a better fit of both the cage and silicone linkage.
   -Linkage Design: This sub-folder contains all linkage mold designs including the 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5mm linkage molds.
 - MATLAB: This serves as the general purpose folder containing all code regarding tracking software, plotting, and more.
 - Revelant Literature: This folder lists current, appropriate sources used to support our work.

Background: Our project aims to study active particles and observe the collective behaviors and aggregated movement emergent upon coupling. In-depth research in this field occurred due to the development of high definition photography which allowed for the detailed scaling of the limb movements for invertebrates and vertebrates. The locomotive functions of the animal's appendages were linked to a central pattern generator in each organism, demonstrating that active particle are driven by autonomous collective movements without the direct influence of a central force. We look to create an accurate model for an adjustable linked filament to mimic cilia-like behaviors by utilizing Hexbugs and 3D-printed Hexbug-like particles to serve as a macroscopic version of the often microscopic particles referenced in the relevant literature. We will create both a battery based and direct voltage sourced filament before applying our filament to model the appendage based movement of a jellyfish. This will allow us to explore how different orientations and combinations of filament power and length affect the velocity of our model’s movement.
