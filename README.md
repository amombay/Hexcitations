ENGN1735: Vibrations of Mechanical Systems Design Project, Active Particles

Hexcitations is a design project for Brown University's School of Engineering course, ENGN1735: Vibrations of Mechanical Systems, completed by Andrew Mombay, Kaya Bruno, Helen Primis, and Sarah Nguyen in collaboration with the Harris Lab inclusive of Jack-William Barotta and Daniel Harris.

This repository contains the following folders:
- CAD Designs: This serves as the general purpose folder containing all CAD designs completed throughout the project, represented across the different iterations and phases of the project.
  -Cage Design: This sub-folder contains all designs of our cages, beginning with our circular cage model before moving to the rectangular, back-held cage model.
    - Iteration I: This sub-folder contains all designs of our intial, circular filament with PVC tubing linkages. These designs were later scrapped and replaced in favor of smaller, more compact linkages as significant issues were faced with friction and mass-dragging due to the sheer weight of the cage and the inability of the hexbug to provide adequate locomotion and movement of the cage for image tracking purposes.
    - Iteration II: This sub-folder contains all designs of our next model where we shifted towards building cages contained on the hexbugs back with a T-shaped marker for tracking purposes along with circular extrusions for the silicone linkages to attach to. This design was later modified and is thus currently redundnant to allow for a better fit on top of the hexbug and silicone linkage.
    - Iteration III: This represents our most current linkage iteration. Modifications were made to the cage to encourage a better fit of both the cage and silicone linkage.
   -Linkage Design: This sub-folder contains all linkage mold designs including the 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5mm linkage molds.
 - MATLAB: This serves as the general purpose folder containing all code regarding tracking software, plotting, and more.
 - Revelant Literature: This folder lists current, appropriate sources used to support our work.
